## Business Database Project Design

### Introduction

Database are structured collections of data tha allow this data to be easily accessed, managed and updated.

How data is organized in a database greatly impacts the performance of an application considering databases are the heart of most business applications, which is why It’s important to properly design databases in order to speed up queries, indexing, and storage among other processes & performance targets.  

### Reading Resource

While working on this project i utilized this resources for learning purposes;-

### The Paakasa Database process

I initially followed the process from the github repo until the Normalization and Denormalization step at which point i realized i needed to revisit the previous SQLs commands as well as the excel file and clean the data a little bit better.

I therefore embarked on proper versioning with creating branches for each step so that i can inspect and perform each step properly.

#### Database Creation & Data Loading  

* I created the file db_pakaasa-create.sql for this step.
* I also made sure to clean the excel data a bit, reduce it and make it a bit relevant to my test project.

### Conclusion

As part of my learning i forked the original project to [my account](https://github.com/piusnmuhumuza/Database-Design) for learning purposes, backup and easy follow-up purposes.
